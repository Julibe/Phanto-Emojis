## Story

### Phanto’s Movie Night 🎬

Phanto is in the movie theater, eyes wide and glued to the screen.
It’s his first time watching a spooky movie, and he’s loving every second of it! 🍿
The lights are dim, the popcorn’s popped, and the screen flickers with eerie shadows.

> "Oh no, I think that ghost is my spirit animal!" Phanto giggles, floating closer to the screen.

Suddenly, a jumpscare! 🧛‍♂️

> "I can do that!" he says, striking a spooky pose.

The movie's full of spooky moments, but for some reason, it's not all scary (not for him), but he definitely digs the vibe!
Will he end up cheering for the ghosts or our heroes? Who knows... he’s torn between both sides! 👻
The thrill of watching fellow ghosts on screen is almost too much for him to handle.

Phanto’s movie night just became a ghostly adventure of its own!
He might even haunt the sequel if it's good enough! 😆
