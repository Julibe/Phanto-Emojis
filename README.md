- Do not use Phanto's description if not necessary.
- Write the story in Markdown format.
- Each adventure story for Phanto should be structured using a YAML front matter block followed by the main Markdown content (Story).

### Phanto's Great Cookie Hunt 🍪

Phanto was having a perfectly happy day until a delicious aroma wafted past his ghostly nose. His little round body jiggled with anticipation. It was the scent of freshly baked cookies!

> "Aha!" he exclaimed, his eyes gleaming. "A cookie caper is afoot!"

He floated through the living room, past the couch, and into the kitchen. The scent grew stronger near the counter. There, sitting on a cooling rack, was a plate of warm, golden-brown cookies.

> "Victory is sweet!" Phanto cheered, his ethereal hands trying to grab one.

Of course, being a ghost, his hands went right through them! He giggled, a playful hum echoing in the kitchen. He decided to try a different approach. He'd just have to *haunt* them into his tummy by gently nudging them off the plate and into his ethereal grasp, one by one. It was a delicious, if slightly clumsy, victory!
