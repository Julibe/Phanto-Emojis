## Story

### Phanto’s Tearful Moment 😭


Phanto sat alone in a corner, his round little ghost face glistening with tears. 😔
He had always been the cheerful, playful ghost, but today... something felt wrong.

> "Why do I feel so unalive?" Phanto whispered, wiping his tears with his little hands.
> "I just... I don’t know what happened."

The little ghost floated around aimlessly, unsure of where to go or what to do.
His heart was heavy, and he just couldn't shake the sadness. 💧

Everywhere he looked, he felt lost. The colors around him seemed dull, and even the chirping birds and gentle breeze felt so far away. 😞

> "Can anyone help me?" Phanto asked, looking up at the sky. "I just want to feel happy again."

It was clear that Phanto needed a little help to brighten his day.

Could you help Phanto dry those tears and bring back his cheerful spirit? 🌈

### Maybe a cookie and a friend would do the trick! 🍪

But just then, something magical happened! 🌟
A gentle breeze swept through the air, making the leaves dance, and suddenly, the sun broke through the clouds. 🌞

Phanto blinked, and for the first time today, he felt a spark of joy.
He took a deep breath and smiled, feeling his heart lift. 💖

> "Wait a minute!" Phanto said, his little ghost face lighting up,
> "This isn’t so bad..."

With a bounce in his step, Phanto floated off into the air, ready to play again!

Turns out, he lost a level on a videogame, but after cleaning those tears, he tried again, defeated that evil strawberry boss, and saved the day! 🌸
The sadness was gone, and the world looked bright once more.

Phanto had found his way back to his cheerful spirit! 🌈
