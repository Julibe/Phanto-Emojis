## Story

### Phanto’s Burger Quest 🍔👻

Phanto’s tummy rumbles louder than a thunderstorm — he’s starving!
Luckily, cheeseburgers are his favorite, even if he’s a ghost and eating isn’t exactly… straightforward.

He hovers over the burger, eyes wide with excitement, ready for that first bite.
But wait — does a ghost even *eat*? He tries anyway!

*One, two, three bites* — poof! The burger disappears; it vanishes!

Phanto’s a little confused. How can something so delicious be gone so fast?
Maybe it’s his ghostly powers, or maybe it’s the burger’s secret escape plan!

Does he care about his waistline? Not at all.
Phanto’s intangible, which means no calories count — score!

Now, with a belly full of nothing but dreams, he’s plotting his next meal for the night.
Watch out, kitchen — Phanto’s coming back for seconds!
