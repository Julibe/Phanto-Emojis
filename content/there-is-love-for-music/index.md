### Phanto’s Haunted Harmony 🎷🎸

Phanto’s day starts with a melody.

As a ghost, he hums tunes that float through the air like magic.
Sometimes it’s jazz, sometimes rock, sometimes obscure tunes — whatever catches his soul! 🎧

Phanto hums so joyfully that neighbors might think his house is haunted…
But it’s really just him filling the air with his ghostly songs.

His favorite duet partner?
**The wind** whistling through the windows, blending perfectly with his cheerful tunes. 🌬️🎵

Music is his magic — an unseen force that turns quiet moments into something unforgettable.
