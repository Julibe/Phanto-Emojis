    Phanto sometimes feels a bit sick, like when his tummy gets all twisty 🌈. But even when he's not feeling his best, he never lets it take away his sparkle.

    ### **Spreading Joy, No Matter What!**

    With a sweet smile, he floats gently through the day, spreading happy, warm feelings to everyone around him. No matter what, Phanto never gives up.

    He keeps going, shining bright, because that’s just who he is.

### Phanto's Little Under the Weather🌈

One foggy morning, Phanto woke up feeling a bit... off. His tummy was doing little backflips, and his glow flickered like a tiny candle in the wind.

> "Oh no... I think I’m gonna..."

He braced himself, expecting something dramatic, but instead, out popped a glowing rainbow burst of magic!

A group of fluffy puppies saw the sparkling spectacle and gasped in awe.

> "WOW! A rainbow! That’s the cutest thing EVER!"

Phanto, feeling a bit embarrassed, shyly said:

> "Ugh... I don’t feel very magical right now..."

Even though he was a little flustered, Phanto couldn't help but notice how happy everyone was. He kept the *rainbow secret* tucked away in his little ghostly heart. His tiny hiccup had made their day! So, instead of floating away in embarrassment, he puffed up his chest and struck an adorable pose.

> "Yes, little ones! That rainbow was *super* eventful, but it might never strike again!"

And with a soft giggle, Phanto wobbled away, his glowing cheeks matching the rainbow he’d left behind, feeling just a little more magical than before.
