### Phanto’s Jungle Adventure 🌿

One minute, Phanto was happily hopping down the Yellow Brick Road, whistling songs and making ghostly giggles. He took a right turn here, then a left turn there and... was it up or down? 🤔 What! He was surrounded by thick trees, colorful parrots squawking, and monkeys swinging from vines! 😱

> "Uh-oh! This is not the Yellow Brick Road!" Phanto said, looking around in confusion.

His round little ghost face showed a mix of wonder and worry. How did he end up here? 🧐

> "I need to find my way back! Which path should I take?" he wondered aloud.

Phanto scratched his head, trying to figure out if the left path led to safety or if the right one would take him even deeper into the jungle. 🌿🌈

- What should Phanto do?
- Will he find his way back to the road?
- Will he get lost in the jungle forever?
- Can you find out how you can help him out?

Guide him to the right path! 🏞️✨
