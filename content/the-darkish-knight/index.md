### Phanto, The Hero We Need

Phanto’s out in full Batman cosplay, taking his role very seriously.
The city’s in for a run for its time as this legendary ghost patrols the streets,
making sure the bad guys stay away and everyone is having a good time.

Phanto’s gadgets, cape, cowl and pure spirit make him the ultimate hero in the city! 🦇

> "I’m not a hero, I am (not) vengeance! I am  (kinda of) the night! I am (definitely not) Batman!!" Phanto says with a serious voice, "cough," "hack," or "ahem",
> swooping through the night, ready to take on any villain in his path.
> "No one can escape justice!"

Every villain that dares to cause trouble knows Phanto is always watching.
Will Phanto’s cookies be enough to defeat them? 🍪
Or will they stop doing evil thanks to the influence of his shadowy cloak? 🌌
