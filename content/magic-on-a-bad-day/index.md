### Phanto’s Sweet Fix for a Bad Day 🌟

Phanto had been having an awesome day! He was swinging on the swings, spinning around in circles, and playing in the playground with joy.
Everything was going perfectly… until he decided to enjoy some ice cream 🍦.

As he flew across the sandbox, his cone accidentally slipped and fell right into the sand! 😞

> "Oh no! My ice cream!" A tear rolled down Phanto’s cheek, and his tiny ghost face turned very sad.

Phanto waved his hands over his face, cleaning his tears. Suddenly, an idea popped into his head: he can get a fresh scoop of ice cream. The solution was right before his eyes! His face changed, and a little shy smile filled with magic appeared 🌈.

> "One scoop of ice cream, please!" Phanto said to the ice cream man.

His little ghost face cheered, his smile back as big as ever. 💖

Phanto twirled around, eating his ice cream while leaving a trail of glittering joy behind. 🌟
Phanto giggled as he floated away, feeling even more magical than before.
